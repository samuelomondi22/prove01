# Overview

For me my ultimate goal is to work at NASA as a computer programmer. So that could be considered my ultimate goal. 

My software right now just prints hello world and pushes it into a github account. Providing an understanding of using git commands. 

Purpose is to set an environment and show I am ready for the sprints.
